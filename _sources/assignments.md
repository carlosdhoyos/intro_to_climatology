# Assignments

## Homework 1:

In this assignment, you will explore recent advancements and challenges in climate modeling by reading the article *The future of climate modeling* by Tapio Schneider et al. {cite}`schneider2023future`. Additionally, you will choose a second article related to this topic to broaden your understanding of the current state of climate modeling and the integration of AI.

This article, *The future of climate modeling*, discusses the current state and future directions of climate modeling. It emphasizes the challenges that traditional models face in accurately simulating climate processes due to limitations in computational resources and data resolution. The authors argue for the integration of advanced machine learning techniques, including AI-driven parameterizations, to improve model accuracy and efficiency. They highlight the need for global collaborations and the development of open-source platforms to accelerate advancements in climate modeling, addressing both scientific and societal needs in the face of climate change {cite}`schneider2023future`.

### Instructions

1. **Read the Primary Article**  
   Read *The future of climate modeling* by Tapio Schneider et al., which discusses the limitations of traditional climate models and suggests ways AI and machine learning can help improve model accuracy and efficiency.

2. **Select a Secondary Article**  
   Choose one of the articles that either:
   - Is cited within the primary article, or
   - Cites the primary article.

You can search for related articles that have cited this work on Google Scholar: [Harnessing AI and computing to advance climate modelling and prediction](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=9155263179351258030&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=es).

3. **High-Level Reading of the Secondary Article**  
   Read the second article at a high level. Focus on understanding the key accomplishments, methods, data used, and main challenges or criticisms discussed in the article. This is a preliminary identification task, so don't worry about understanding every technical detail.

4. **Presentation Preparation**  
   Create a 4-slide presentation summarizing your findings. Each slide should address the following points:
   - **Slide 1**: Summary of the primary article.   
   - **Slide 2**: The most important accomplishments and contributions of the secondary article.
   - **Slide 3**: Any criticisms, challenges, or limitations highlighted in the article.
   - **Slide 4**: Data, methods, and any unique insights or "curiosities" that stood out to you.

   The presentation should be concise and highlight only the most critical points.

### Deliverables
- Submit your 4-slide presentation as a PowerPoint/PDF/Google Sheets link.
- Be prepared to discuss your findings in class.
