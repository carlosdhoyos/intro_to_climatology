# Assignments

## Homework 1:

In this assignment, you will delve into foundational concepts in climatology by reading **Chapter 1 of *Global Physical Climatology* by Dennis Hartmann**. This chapter introduces key components of the Earth's climate system and provides foundational knowledge for understanding atmospheric processes and energy balance.

### Instructions

1. **Read Chapter 1 in Hartmann**
   - Read the first chapter thoroughly, focusing on the principles of Earth’s energy balance, the structure of the atmosphere, and the components of the climate system.
   - Pay special attention to the figures in this chapter, as they visually represent core concepts that we will analyze in this assignment.

2. **Reconstruct Figures Using NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Data**
   - Using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data, reproduce the following figures from Chapter 1:
     - **Figure 1.5**: Global distribution of annual average incoming solar radiation.
     - **Figure 1.6**: Global distribution of annual average outgoing longwave radiation.
     - **Figure 1.7**: Zonal averages of incoming and outgoing radiation.
     - **Figure 1.8**: Annual average surface temperature distribution.
     - **Figure 1.9**: Zonal average surface temperature by latitude.

   These plots can be generated using Python with libraries like `xarray`, `matplotlib`, and `numpy`. The goal is to practice handling real climate data and gain a deeper understanding of the patterns and concepts introduced in the textbook.

3. **Presentation Preparation**
   - Prepare a 4-slide presentation summarizing your work and analysis:
     - **Slide 1**: Brief summary of Chapter 1 and the importance of the figures you reconstructed.
     - **Slide 2**: Reconstructed plot(s) with a description of the data source and methodology used.
     - **Slide 3**: Observations and insights from each plot. Discuss any patterns or anomalies you noticed.
     - **Slide 4**: Reflection on challenges in the data reconstruction process, such as data resolution limitations or unexpected results.

   This presentation should be concise and focus on the interpretation of the plots and their relevance to understanding Earth’s energy balance and climate dynamics.

### Deliverables
- Submit your 4-slide presentation as a PowerPoint, PDF, or Google Slides link.
- Be prepared to present your findings and discuss your interpretations of the plots in class.
